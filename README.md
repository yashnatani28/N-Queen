# N-Queen
Objective
1. To arrange the N queens on a NxN Chess Board in such a way that No Queen
attacks any other queen.
2. Generate a large number of N-Queen instances and solve them by Hill Climbing, Hill
Climbing with Random Restart and Simulated Annealing Algorithms.
3. Compare the three algorithms in terms of Search Cost and Percentage of Solved
Problems.

Algorithms used

I.
<b>Simple Hill Climbing</b>\
The Simple Hill Climbing Algorithm is a local search algorithm in which the
movement is in the direction of increasing elevation or value until it reaches the
peak or provides the best possible solution for the problem.
Algorithm for Simple Hill Climbing\
Step 1. Evaluate the initial state. If it is a goal state then stop and return
success. Otherwise, make initial state as current state.\
Step 2. Loop until the solution state is found or there are no new operators
present which can be applied to the current state.\
a. Select a state that has not been yet applied to the current state and
apply it to produce a new state.\
b. Perform these to evaluate new state\
i.If the current state is a goal state, then stop and return
success.\
ii.If it is better than the current state, then make it current
state and proceed further.\
iii.If it is not better than the current state, then continue in the
loop until a solution is found.\
Step 3. Exit


II.
<b>Hill Climbing with Random Restart</b>\
In hill climbing with Random Restart, many hill climbing searches are done from
randomly generated initial states. Each search is done until it stops or doesn’t show
any progress.\
Algorithm : Hill Climbing with Random Restart\
Step 1. Start with a random state (i.e., a random configuration of Queens on
the board)\
Step 2. Scan through all possible neighbours of the current state and jump to
the neighbour with the best heuristic value (less cost), if found any. If
there does not exist, a neighbour, with heuristic cost strictly lesser than
the current state, randomly generate a new configuration of queens on the
board.\
Step 3. Repeat step 2, until a state whose objective is strictly higher than all
its neighbour’s objectives, is found or Random Restart Limit is reached
and then go to step 4.\
Step 4. If Random Restart Limit is reached, we stop finding the solution. Else
otherwise, the state thus found after the local search is either the local
optimum or the global optimum. There is no way of escaping local optima
but adding a random restart each time a local optimum is encountered
increases the chances of achieving global optimum (the solution to our
problem).\
Step 5. Output & Exit

III.
<b>Hill Climbing with Simulated Annealing</b>\
Simulated Annealing is a technique of optimization which is based on exploration. It
is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of the heuristic
function rather than local optima.\
Algorithm : Hill Climbing with Simulated Annealing\
Step 1. Start with a random state ‘S’ (i.e., a random configuration of
Queens on the board) and calculate its cost.\
Step 2. Define the Temperature and Schedule variable for Annealing
process.\
Step 3. Generate a random neighbourhood state ‘S1’ and evaluate its
objective function.\
Step 4. d=F(S) - F(S1); where, d is the change in objective fn between
S & S1. If d<0, replace current state S with neighbourhood state
S1. Else find the Probability of S1 to find if it’s feasible to accept a
locally bad .\
Step 5. Decrease the Temperature with the help of schedule.\
Step 6. Repeat steps 2-5 until Objective function becomes 0(meaning
soln is found) or Temperature becomes 0(soln can’t be found).\
Step 7. Exit
